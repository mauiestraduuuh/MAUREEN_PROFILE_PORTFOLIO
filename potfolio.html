                <p>Hi, I am Maureen Estrada, 3rd year BSIS Student in Technological University of the Philippines. I am also a content creator on Tiktok, mostly known as @noturpotatocrush. I've been doing content creation for 2 years.</p>
                <p>My course of choice is far from the industry I am trying to fit in, but the choice was made with practical reasons. Studying a course, I know nothing about and interest in has been the difficult situation I've been in, but with my friends it is bearable.</p>

            <h3>Project 1: Poker Game</h3>
            <img src="images/profile/stud.png" width="300">
            <p>First project as a freshman. We were told to make our own game, and my group chose Poker.</p>
            <p>Technologies used: <br> 1. C Programming Language: Known for performance and system control. <br>
                2. Standard Libraries: Includes libraries like stdio.h for input/output, stdlib.h for random number generation, and math.h for mathematical functions.<br>
                3. Data Structures: Uses arrays and floats to manage card values and player scores.<br>
                4. Game Logic: Functions modularize tasks such as shuffling cards, calculating scores, and displaying results.<br>
                5. Control Structures: Employs loops and conditionals for iteration and decision-making.<br>
                6. User Interface: Provides a text-based interface for user interaction.<br>
                7. Random Number Generation: Uses rand() and srand() for card generation.<br>
                8.Delays: Implements a custom delay function for simulating pauses.</p>

            <h3>Project 2: Minesweeper</h3>
            <img src="images/profile/mine.png" width="300">
            <p>We were instructed to do a minesweeper game in c++ using parameter passing and returning results.</p>
            <p>Technologies used: <br> 1.Two-dimensional arrays to represent the game board and mines. <br>
                2. Functions for modular organization, handling user input, and managing game logic. <br>
                3. Random mine placement using rand() seeded with the current time. <br>
                4. User interaction for gameplay, displaying the board, and checking win/loss conditions.</p>

            <h3>Project 3: Typing Tutor</h3>
            <img src="images/profile/type.png" width="300">
            <p>This project is for slow typers to improve their typing speed.</p>
            <p>Technologies used: <br> 1. C Programming Language: The entire application is developed in C, employing its standard libraries for various functionalities.
                <br> 2. File I/O: Utilizes file operations to read and write user data to a text file (users.txt).
                <br> 3.Standard Libraries:
                <br>stdio.h: For input and output operations.
                <br>stdlib.h: For general utilities and random number generation.
                <br>string.h: For string manipulation.
                <br>time.h: For measuring time during typing tests.
                <br>4. Control Structures: Implements loops and conditionals to manage user interactions and program flow.
                <br>5. Random Phrase Generation: Uses rand() to create random typing phrases.</p>
